Write a program that reads marks in five subjects and calculates the average.

If the average is a whole number, print it as an integer.

If the average is not a whole number, print it with exactly two digits after the decimal point.

Constraints:
0 <= marks in each subject <= 100

Input Format:
Five integers, each on a separate line, representing marks in five subjects.

Output Format:
Print the average marks following the rules above.

Sample Input:
50
50
50
50
50

Sample Output:
50

Sample Input:
45
93
23
45
65

Sample Output:
54.20

SOLUTION:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      int a = sc.nextInt();
      int b = sc.nextInt();
      int c = sc.nextInt();
      int d = sc.nextInt();
      int e = sc.nextInt();
      int tot = a+b+c+d+e;
      double avg = tot/5.00;
      
      if (avg == (int) avg) {
            System.out.println((int) avg);
        } else {
            System.out.printf("%.2f", avg);
        }
      
       
  }
}
