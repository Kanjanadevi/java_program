priya is writing a Java program that needs to take two kinds of input from the user â€” first an integer, and then a sentence on the next line.
However, after entering the integer, when she tries to type the sentence, the program immediately skips the input line and prints an empty output.
Write a Java program that correctly reads both the integer and the sentence, and then prints them on separate lines.

Input Format:

First line: An integer
Second line: A string (can contain spaces)
Output Format:

Print the integer on the first line
Print the string on the second line
Sample Input:
7

Sample Output:
7
Learning Java is fun

SOLUTION:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int num = sc.nextInt();   
        sc.nextLine();    
        String sentence = sc.nextLine();  
        System.out.println(num);
        System.out.println(sentence);
  }
}
