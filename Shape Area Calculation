Veena wants to learn how to calculate the area of different shapes (Square, Rectangle, Circle, Triangle) and implement it in programming.
Write a program to calculate the area of each shape based on the given inputs.

Formulas:

Square:Area=a×a
Rectangle:Area=l×b
Circle:Area=πr^2 (Use π = 3.14159, round to 2 decimal places)
Triangle:Area=(1/2)×b×h
Input Format:

First input: Integer for side of square (a)
Second and third input: Integers for length (l) and breadth (b) of rectangle
Fourth input: Integer for radius (r) of circle
Fifth and sixth input: Integers for base (B) and height (h) of triangle
Constraints:
No constraints

Output Format:
Print the area of each shape in the following format:

Area of Square=...
Area of Rectangle=...
Area of Circle=...
Area of Triangle=...
Sample Input 0:
2
3
2
3
6
5

Sample Output 0:
Area of Square=4
Area of Rectangle=6
Area of Circle=28.27
Area of Triangle=15



SOLUTION:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in);
      int s = sc.nextInt();
      int le = sc.nextInt();
      int br = sc.nextInt();
      int r = sc.nextInt();
      int ba = sc.nextInt();
      int he = sc.nextInt();
      
      double Ca= 3.14*r*r;
      System.out.println("Area of Square="+ s*s);
      System.out.println("Area of Rectangle="+ le*br);
      System.out.print("Area of Circle=");
      System.out.printf("%.2f\n",Ca);
      System.out.println("Area of Triangle="+(ba*he)/2);
  }
}
